## 🚨 The Problem: Financial Privacy is Broken

### Real-Life Story

**Alice**, a legendary dev, won the Move AI Hack and received $13,000 prize money.

**Bob**, another participant who won another prize in the same hackathon, discovered his co-founder wasn't trustworthy about receiving prize money. Bob texted all 12 winners asking for the organizer's wallet address. Within minutes, using blockchain explorers and intelligence tools, he identified:
- Which wallet belonged to whom
- Exactly how much each person received
- Their entire transaction history

**This is a serious concern.** Nobody wants their wallet exposed — it makes them vulnerable to targeted attacks, extortion, and financial loss.

### The Core Issues

❌ **Payments on public blockchains are NOT private**
- Traceable through tools like Arkham Intelligence
- Trackable via Dune Analytics and explorers
- Identifiable by anyone with basic skills

❌ **Results:**
- Fear of transacting
- Inconvenience for legitimate users
- Financial loss from targeted attacks
- Privacy violations for everyone

---

## ✅ The Solution: PrivatePay

**Where every transaction is fully private, anonymous, unidentifiable, and untrackable.**

### Core Benefits

- ✨ **Sender privacy**: Your wallet is never linked to the transaction
- ✨ **Receiver privacy**: Recipients' identities remain hidden
- ✨ **Observer blindness**: Third parties see nothing linkable
- ✨ **Simple UX**: Like Stripe links, but every transaction is a new, invisible wallet

### Key Features

🔒 **Infinite Untraceable Stealth Accounts**
- Each payment generates a fresh stealth sub-account
- Unlimited transactions, unlimited mixers
- One single DarkPool

💼 **Static Payment Links**
- Share a single payment link (e.g., `amaan.privatepay.me`)
- Each access generates a unique stealth address
- No complex setup required

🔐 **Complete Unlinkability**
- Sender cannot identify receiver
- Receiver cannot identify sender
- Observers see nothing linkable

### Cryptographic Flow

```
1. Meta Address Generation
   ├─ Generate spend key pair (spendPriv, spendPub)
   ├─ Generate viewing key pair (viewingPriv, viewingPub)
   └─ metaAddress = (spendPub, viewingPub)

2. Stealth Address Generation
   ├─ Generate ephemeral key pair (ephemeralPriv, ephemeralPub)
   ├─ Compute shared secret: ECDH(ephemeralPriv, viewingPub)
   ├─ Compute tweak: SHA256(sharedSecret || k)
   ├─ Derive stealth public key: stealthPub = spendPub + (tweak * G)
   └─ Derive Aptos address: SHA3_256(stealthPub)[0:16]

3. Payment Detection
   ├─ Recipient computes: ECDH(viewingPriv, ephemeralPub)
   ├─ Checks view hint matches
   ├─ Derives stealth address
   └─ Checks blockchain for funds

4. Fund Withdrawal
   ├─ Compute stealth private key: stealthPriv = spendPriv + tweak
   ├─ Sign transaction with stealthPriv
   └─ Transfer funds to main wallet
```

## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

Below is a concise, technical view of how the full PrivatePay system is wired across chains and infra.

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant UI as PrivatePay Web App
  participant Wallet as Wallet Adapters
  participant Chain as Blockchain Networks
  participant Infra as Infrastructure Services
  participant Relayer as Bridge Relayers

  User->>UI: Open PrivatePay
  UI->>Supabase: Load user data, payment links
  Supabase-->>UI: User state, balances

  User->>UI: Connect wallet
  UI->>Wallet: Request connection
  Wallet-->>UI: Account addresses, network

  User->>UI: Initiate private payment
  UI->>Wallet: Sign transaction
  Wallet->>Chain: Broadcast transaction
  Chain-->>Wallet: Transaction hash
  Wallet-->>UI: Confirmation

  Note over Chain,Infra: Chain-specific integrations

  Chain->>Helius: Solana enhanced RPC
  Chain->>ArciumMPC: Private DeFi operations
  Chain->>AztecL2: Starknet privacy layer
  Chain->>Axelar: Cross-chain messaging

  Note over Relayer,Chain: Zcash bridge operations

  Relayer->>Zcash: Monitor deposits
  Zcash-->>Relayer: Transaction events
  Relayer->>Miden: Relay to Miden
  Relayer->>Starknet: Relay to Starknet
  Relayer->>Solana: Relay to Solana
  Relayer->>Osmosis: Relay to Osmosis

  Chain-->>UI: Updated balances, state
  UI-->>User: Show transaction status
```

At the center is the **React/Vite** app, which talks to wallets, chains, Supabase, and relayer backends. Privacy is enforced through:

- **Stealth meta-address registries** on Aptos, Starknet, Solana, Near, Fhenix.
- **Bridge programs** on Solana, Starknet, Miden, Axelar, Osmosis representing sZEC / private tickets.
- **Relayer logic** that connects Zcash with all other chains.

### Stealth Meta-Address Flow (Aptos, Starknet, Solana)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Sender
  participant Recipient
  participant Chain

  Note over Recipient: 1) Generate meta address (spendPub, viewingPub)

  Sender->>Recipient: Ask for meta address
  Sender->>Sender: Generate ephemeral key (ephemeralPriv, ephemeralPub)
  Sender->>Sender: shared = ECDH(ephemeralPriv, viewingPub)
  Sender->>Sender: tweak = H(shared || k)
  Sender->>Sender: stealthPub = spendPub + tweak·G
  Sender->>Chain: Pay to stealthAddress(stealthPub)

  Recipient->>Recipient: shared' = ECDH(viewingPriv, ephemeralPub)
  Recipient->>Recipient: Derive same tweak & stealthPub
  Recipient->>Chain: Scan for funds at stealthAddress
  Recipient->>Recipient: stealthPriv = spendPriv + tweak
  Recipient->>Chain: Withdraw to main wallet
```
